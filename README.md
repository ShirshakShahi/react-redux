## Deep diving into Redux

### Here we learn about Redux Toolkit in this master branch

I made mistake that i mistakely pushed my first codes to redux-toolkit branch and the actual redux-toolkit learning codes in this master branch.

So, I would recommend to first go this branch first [first-main-branch](https://github.com/ShirshakShahi/react-redux/tree/redux-toolkit)


### npm install @reduxjs/toolkit

Here we can use {configureStore, createSlice} in our component. It makes the method writing easier,We can now less care about typos in our code while dispatching the type of reducer functions.
